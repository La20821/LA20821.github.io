        <h2 id ="one">About Me</h2>
        <p>I am orginally from the Chicagoland area, born and raised. I've always been fairly ambitious and known to take huge leaps. What you're viewing right now is a product of one actually. My background is Manufacturing Engineering. However, I worked as a quality engineer for two years prior to switching to coding. I am excited about this shift and hope that you will be too after viewing. </p>
